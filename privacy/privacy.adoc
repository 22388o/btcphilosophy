== Privacy

Bitcoin can be described as a pseudonomous system, where users can
have multiple pseudonyms in the form of public keys. At first glance,
this looks like a pretty good way to keep users from being identified,
but it's really easy to accidentally leak financial information to
people you didn't intend to give it to.

We are going to look at what privacy means in the context of Bitcoin
and why you'd want privacy in the first place. Some well known privacy attack vectors,
both on-chain and off-chain, are also discussed.

=== What does privacy mean?

Privacy can mean different things in different contexts, but in
Bitcoin it generally means that users don't have to reveal their
financial information to others, unless they voluntarily do so.

There are lots of ways in which you may leak your private information
to others, with or without knowing it. This can leak both from the
public blockchain and through other means, for example intercepting
your internet communication.

=== Why is privacy important?

It may seem obvious why privacy is important in Bitcoin, but there are
privacy aspects you might not immediately think about. Gregory
Maxwell, on the Bitcoin Talk forum
(https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=334316.msg3588908#msg3588908),
walks us through a lot of good reasons why he thinks privacy
matters. Among them is fungibility:

____
Financial privacy is an essential element to fungibility in Bitcoin:
if you can meaningfully distinguish one coin from another, then their
fungibility is weak. If our fungibility is too weak in practice, then
we cannot be decentralized: if someone important announces a list of
stolen coins they won't accept coins derived from, you must carefully
check coins you accept against that list and return the ones that
fail.  Everyone gets stuck checking blacklists issued by various
authorities because in that world we'd all not like to get stuck with
bad coins. This adds friction and transactional costs and makes
Bitcoin less valuable as a monetary medium.
____

Maxwell also explains how privacy is important for a free market, your
personal safety, and human dignity.

Now that we've got a grip on why privacy matters, let's have a look at
Bitcoin's privacy in practice.

=== On-chain privacy

On-chain privacy refers to the information you disclose in
transactions on the blockchain. It can be transactions you make or
transactions other people make to send you money.

Satoshi Nakamoto ponders around on-chain privacy in section 7 of his Bitcoin paper
https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf[Bitcoin paper]footnote:[https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf]:

[quote, Satoshi Nakamoto, the Bitcoin paper (https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)]
____
As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each
transaction to keep them from being linked to a common owner. Some
linking is still unavoidable with multi-input transactions, which
necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner. The
risk is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal
other transactions that belonged to the same owner.
____

The paper summarizes the main problems of Bitcoin on-chain privacy:
Address reuse and address clustering, the ability to decide, with some
level of certainty, that a set of different addresses belong to the
same user.

Chris Belcher wrote in great detail about the different kinds of
privacy leaks that can happen on the Bitcoin blockchain
(https://en.bitcoin.it/Privacy#Blockchain_attacks_on_privacy). We
recommend you to read at least the first few subsections under
"Blockchain attacks on privacy."

The takeaway is that privacy in Bitcoin isn't perfect. It requires a
significant amount of work to transact privately. Most people aren't
prepared to go that far for privacy. It seems there is a clear
trade-off between privacy and usability.

Another aspect of privacy is that your privacy measures affects other
users as well. If you are sloppy with your privacy, other people might
experience reduced privacy too. Gregory Maxwell explains this in a
simple manner on the same Bitcoin Talk discussion that we linked above
(https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=334316.msg3589252#msg3589252),
and concludes with an example:

____
This actually works in practice, too... A nice whitehat hacker on IRC
was playing around with brainwallet cracking and hit a phrase with
~250 BTC in it.  We were able to identify the owner from just the
address alone, because they'd been paid by a Bitcoin service that
reused addresses and he was able to talk them into giving up the users
contact information. He actually got the user on the phone, they were
shocked and confusedâ€” but grateful to not be out their coin.  A happy
ending there. (This isn't the only example of it, by far ... but its
one of the more fun ones).
____

In this case, all went well thanks to the philantropically minded
hacker, but don't count on that next time.

=== Off-chain privacy

While the blockchain proves to be a notorious source of privacy leaks,
there are plenty of other techniques that don't use the blockchain,
some sneakier than others. These range from key-loggers to network
traffic analysis. To read up on some of these methods, please refer
again to Chris Belcher's piece, specifically the section
"Non-blockchain attacks on privacy"
(https://en.bitcoin.it/Privacy#Non-blockchain_attacks_on_privacy).

Among a plethora of attacks, Belcher mentions the possibility of
someone snooping on your internet connection, for example your ISP:

____
If the adversary sees a transaction or block coming out of your node
which did not previously enter, then it can know with near-certainty
that the transaction was made by you or the block was mined by you. As
internet connections are involved, the adversary will be able to link
the IP address with the discovered bitcoin information.
____

Again, protecting against the wide range of attacks is hard and you
probably won't fully be able to, so you have to use some kind of
trade-off between convenience and privacy that works for you.


=== Conclusion

Privacy is hard, and there is no privacy silver bullet. To get decent
privacy in Bitcoin you have to take active measures that are costly
and time-consuming.
